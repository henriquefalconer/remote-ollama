# remote-ollama-proxy ai-client

macOS client setup for connecting to remote Ollama, supporting Aider (v1) and Claude Code (v2+ - planned).

## Current Status

**✅ v1 (Available Now)**: Aider integration with OpenAI-compatible API
**🚧 v2+ (In Development)**: Claude Code integration, analytics, version management

This README documents both current (v1) and planned (v2+) features. Features marked "v2+" are not yet implemented.

## Overview

The remote-ollama-proxy ai-client is a one-time installer that configures your macOS environment to use remote Ollama via OpenAI-compatible APIs.

**Currently available (v1)**:
- **Aider** (and other OpenAI-compatible tools) connect to remote Ollama automatically
- Zero manual configuration per session
- All API calls go through the secure Tailscale network

**Planned (v2+, not yet available)**:
- Claude Code integration with optional remote Ollama backend
- Performance analytics tools for measuring tool usage
- Version compatibility management for Claude Code + Ollama

## What v1 Does (Available Now)

1. Installs and configures Tailscale membership
2. Creates environment variables pointing to remote Ollama server
3. Installs Aider with automatic Ollama connection
4. Provides clean uninstallation

## Roadmap: v2+ Planned Features (Not Yet Available)

The following features are documented in the specifications but not yet implemented. They are planned for future releases:

### Claude Code Integration (v2+ - Planned)

**Goal**: Optional integration allowing Claude Code to use remote Ollama backend as an alternative to Anthropic cloud API.

**Planned capabilities**:
- Shell alias (`claude-ollama`) for easy backend switching
- Opt-in during installation (user consent required)
- Support for both Anthropic cloud (default) and remote Ollama backend
- Backend selection based on use case (cloud for complex tasks, Ollama for privacy-critical work)

**Why this matters**: Some users may prefer running inference on their private Tailscale network for sensitive code. However, Anthropic cloud API will remain the default and recommended option due to superior quality and performance (prompt caching support).

### Performance Analytics (v2+ - Planned)

**Goal**: Measure actual Claude Code tool usage and performance to make data-driven decisions about backend suitability.

**Planned tools**:
- `loop-with-analytics.sh` - Enhanced execution with performance measurement
- `compare-analytics.sh` - Compare performance between different backends

**What would be measured**:
- Tool usage counts (Read, Bash, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Task spawns)
- Token usage (input, cache creation/reads, output)
- Cache efficiency (hit rate percentage)
- Workload classification (shallow vs deep operations)

**Why this matters**: Empirical data to validate whether remote Ollama is suitable for specific workflows, or if Anthropic cloud API's prompt caching provides essential performance benefits.

### Version Management (v2+ - Planned)

**Goal**: Prevent breaking changes from Claude Code or Ollama updates.

**Planned tools**:
- `check-compatibility.sh` - Verify Claude Code and Ollama versions are tested together
- `pin-versions.sh` - Lock tools to known-working versions
- `downgrade-claude.sh` - Rollback Claude Code if update breaks

**Why this matters**: Ollama's Anthropic API compatibility is experimental. Claude Code updates may require features Ollama doesn't support yet. Version management would prevent downtime from breaking changes.

**Current workaround**: For now, users can manually track working version combinations and avoid automatic updates of Claude Code when using it with Ollama.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 Sonoma or later
- Homebrew
- Python 3.10+
- Tailscale account
- Access to a remote-ollama-proxy ai-server (must be invited to the same Tailscale network)

## Installation

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions.

Quick start:
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

## API Contract

The client relies on the exact API contract documented in [specs/API_CONTRACT.md](specs/API_CONTRACT.md).

The remote Ollama server provides:
- OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoints (native Ollama feature)
- Hostname resolution via Tailscale
- Support for streaming, JSON mode, tool calling
- No authentication required (network-layer security)

## Usage

The client has **no persistent daemon or background service**. It only configures environment variables that tools use to connect to remote Ollama.

### Running Aider

After installation, simply run:
```bash
aider                     # interactive mode
aider --yes               # YOLO mode
```

Aider automatically reads the environment variables and connects to remote Ollama.

### Using Other Tools

Any tool that supports custom OpenAI base URLs will work automatically:
```bash
# Environment variables are already set
echo $OPENAI_API_BASE    # http://ai-server:11434/v1
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY     # ollama
```

### No Service Management Required

Unlike the Ollama server, the client requires no start/stop/restart commands. Simply invoke tools when needed.

## Testing & Verification

### Running the Test Suite

The client includes a comprehensive automated test suite that verifies installation and connectivity:

```bash
# Run all tests (27 tests covering environment, dependencies, connectivity, API contract, and Aider)
./scripts/test.sh

# Run tests without server connectivity checks (useful during initial setup)
./scripts/test.sh --skip-server

# Run only critical tests (skip API contract validation and Aider integration)
./scripts/test.sh --quick

# Run with verbose output (shows full API request/response details and timing)
./scripts/test.sh --verbose
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite validates:
- **Environment Configuration** (7 tests): env file exists, all 4 variables set correctly, shell profile sourcing, variables exported
- **Dependencies** (6 tests): Tailscale connected, Homebrew installed, Python 3.10+, pipx installed, Aider installed
- **Connectivity** (6 tests): Server reachable, all API endpoints responding, error handling
- **API Contract** (5 tests): Base URL formats, HTTP status codes, response schemas, streaming with usage data
- **Aider Integration** (3 tests): Binary in PATH, environment variables configured
- **Script Behavior** (3 tests): Uninstall script available, valid syntax, install idempotency
