0a. Study `server/specs/*` and `client/specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study @AGENTS.md to understand component responsibilities and coordination.
0d. For reference, the server implementation will be in `server/scripts/*` and client implementation in `client/scripts/*` and `client/config/*`.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 Sonnet subagents to study existing implementation in `server/scripts/*` and `client/scripts/*` and compare it against `server/specs/*` and `client/specs/*`. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete using subagents.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. This is a monorepo with separate server and client components — maintain clear separation except via the API contract in `client/specs/API_CONTRACT.md`. You can commit your changes.

ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to achieve [project-specific goal]. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at `server/specs/FILENAME.md` or `client/specs/FILENAME.md` as appropriate. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent.
